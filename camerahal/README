msm7x30 camera HAL

With the arrival of Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) the way that cameras are
interfaced has changed significantly. The code thrown together here is
an attempt to arrive at a point whereby the camera on my phone works.

The phone is an HTC Desire HD. I've been working with the CyanogenMod
repositories, but this code should be generic enough to work for all
those with custom ROM's and should also be easily adaptable to support
other Qualcomm chipsets.

There is very little information easily available about the sensor and
how it should be used, but the kernel driver module from Code Aurora is
useful.

It would be nice if HTC would release the code to their liboemcamera so
that efforts like this could be completed faster and with more success.
Sadly I suspect that pigs will be flying past my window before that
happens.

I'm far from the most qualified (or even slightly qualified for that matter)
so all help welcome :-)
